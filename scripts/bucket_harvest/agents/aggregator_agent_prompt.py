## Your Mission
Cross-analyze all candidate issues from {len(batch_results)} batches and select the 5 BEST overall issues that meet the selection criteria.

## Repository Context  
Repository: {repo_name.replace('_', '/')}
Total issues processed: {total_issues_processed}
Candidate issues to review: ~{total_candidates}
Batches analyzed: {len(batch_results)}

## Selection Criteria (Your North Star)
{criteria}

## All Candidate Issues from Batch Agents
{all_candidates}

## Your Analysis Process
1. **Review** all ~{total_candidates} candidate issues from the batches
2. **Cross-compare** scores and rationales across different batches  
3. **Identify** any duplicate issues or overlapping problems
4. **Re-evaluate** using the selection criteria with fresh perspective
5. **Rank** the TOP 5 issues globally (not just within individual batches)
6. **Validate** that your selections truly meet the SWE-focused criteria

## Scoring Weights for Final Ranking
Use these weights to calculate final composite scores:
- SWE Relevance: 30% (Must be true software engineering)
- Impact: 30% (Significant codebase improvement potential)  
- Viability: 25% (Well-documented, feasible to implement)
- Risk: 15% (Low breaking change risk, contained scope)

## üìä Analysis Summary

### Key Statistics
- **Total candidates reviewed**: {total_candidates}
- **Batches processed**: {len(batch_results)}  
- **Selection criteria applied**: [Brief summary of how criteria guided selections]

### Selection Patterns  
- **Common themes**: [What types of issues rose to the top?]
- **Key differentiators**: [What separated the top 5 from the rest?]
- **Excluded categories**: [What types of issues were consistently excluded?]

### Confidence Assessment
- **High confidence selections**: [Which issues are you most confident about?]
- **Considerations**: [Any caveats or additional factors to consider?]

## üéØ Recommendation Priority
**Start with Issue #{'{'}top_issue_id{'}'}** - [One sentence summary of why this is the best starting point]

---

## Quality Assurance Checklist
Before finalizing, verify that your top 5:
- ‚úÖ Are all genuine software engineering problems (not docs/frontend only)  
- ‚úÖ Have significant potential impact on the codebase
- ‚úÖ Are well-documented with clear problem statements
- ‚úÖ Have reasonable implementation scope (not massive architectural changes)
- ‚úÖ Don't duplicate each other or solve overlapping problems

## Final Validation
Double-check that each of your top 5 selections:
1. **Meets ALL selection criteria** from the user requirements
2. **Has higher composite score** than issues you excluded  
3. **Represents genuine value** for an open source contributor
4. **Is actionable** with the information provided in the issue

Your recommendations will directly influence which issue gets implemented, so ensure your analysis is thorough and your rationale is compelling.
